Building parametric geometry in Dynamo for Revit with Python.

1. Launch Dynamo **inside Revit**, open a Python Script node.
2. The 10‑storey script: it creates levels, walls and floor slabs via Revit API.
3. Ensure Background Preview is on and press ZA in a 3‑D view to locate the model.
4. When nothing appears, remember Dynamo only displays objects returned through OUT; send walls or solids, not strings.
   Experiment by adjusting dimensions, floors, or adding windows. Enjoy rapid iterative modeling!
